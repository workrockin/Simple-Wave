# SIMPLE WλVE

Simple Wave is an open, for profit, collaborative project to provide inexpensive last mile communication technology. Any one , whether it be an infrastructure provider, a service provider, an operator or an individual, is free to join the Simple Wave project. 

In its most basic form Simple Wave consists of a base station. All Simple Wave stations must confirm to the following 3 principles

1. Technology based on **open** standards. Open source software for operation. Open cellular frequencies for communication. Standards which can be used by all. And is compatible with maximum number of devices. To minimize the setup, distribution and working costs.
2. All stations must operate in **online and offline** modes. Even when the network is unavailable the stations must provide core services as a part of its operation. Network independent services will be accessed by the users wirelessly in the same way they access network services.
3. Single point of access managed via a **secure identity** program. All Simple Wave stations will be compatible with each other. A user with access to one Simple Wave station will be able to access any Simple Wave station anywhere in the world.

*Please note that the access here means access to the network. Application services may employ their own identity management and restrictions. So while a user will always be able to access Simple Wave station, the services may/may not be accessible depending upon the situation.*

# What can you do with Simple Wave? 

Simple Wave can be a wireless internet gateway, a back-haul, a voice calling service, a messaging platform. CRM, e-commerce, news feed, social network. Video game server or a movie streaming station. Simple wave can be anything you want. And maybe even more.

As long as Simple Wave collaborators and partners agree to the principles above they can deploy Simple Wave stations in any way they want.

Want to charge for internet access? Sure. Simple Wave allows you to run accounting on identities.

Want to give away free service? Simple Wave lets you do that too.

Want to deploy business specific applications? Go right ahead and never look back.

Simple wave is flexible enough to serve different geographical areas. In coastal areas with direct access to fiber optic cables, Simple Wave may be used as a feeder/backhaul for inland connectivity. Simple Wave coastal distributors may be used offer cheaper data plans to encourage tourism.

In inlands Simple Wave is capable of dense deployments to handle peak demands. Further Simple Wave stations may also allow access to specific technologies that encourage effective administration and development of smart cities.

Simple Wave may be attached to an antenna on ground or mounted on a satellite and sent into orbit. Simple Wave does not make any assumptions on how to best use it. It leaves it to the operators. As long as an operator confirms to Simple Wave guiding principles they are free to do what they want.

Simple wave is a convergent telecommunication technology that aims to promote open, standardized cellular infrastructure to decrease the associated costs in setting up of telecommunication technology and increase the rate of innovation in the world.

It is our belief that Simple Wave will multiply the effect of other service industries rapidly by giving them a wider reach to an audience that would otherwise not be able to have access to their products.

Simple wave is a cross functional collaborative project. We are eager to work with people in different industries. Technology, manufacturing, hospitality, education, finance, retail , arts,science,government etc.
